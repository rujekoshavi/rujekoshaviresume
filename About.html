    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <section>
      <p>
        Hello! I’m <strong>Rujeko Shavi</strong>, a Master’s student in Software Engineering at 
        <strong>Kennesaw State University</strong>. With a strong foundation in Biology and 
        several years of professional laboratory experience, I’m passionate about combining 
        science and technology to create innovative solutions in the biotech space.

      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>
        I hold a <strong>Bachelor of Science degree in Biology</strong> from 
        <strong>Northern State University</strong>. During my undergraduate and professional 
        career, I gained hands-on research and lab experience, including RNA/DNA extraction, 
        PCR, molecular biology techniques, and quality control in clinical lab environments.  
        I have worked with instruments such as <em>Alinity M</em>, <em>Integra Viaflo 96</em>, and 
        performed detailed lab procedures to ensure accuracy and reliability of results.

      <h2>Why Software Engineering?</h2>
      <p>
        Working in labs gave me first-hand exposure to the critical role of technology in 
        research and healthcare. I became fascinated by the potential of software to improve 
        efficiency, automate workflows, and unlock new possibilities in biotech and life sciences.  
        This inspired me to pursue a graduate degree in <strong>Software Engineering</strong>, 
        where I am learning programming, system design, data analysis, and software development 
        practices to complement my science background.

      <h2>Future Goals</h2>
      <p>
        My long-term goal is to work at the intersection of <strong>biotechnology and software 
        engineering</strong>. I aim to design and build tools that support researchers, 
        healthcare professionals, and pharmaceutical companies in solving complex biological 
        problems. By merging biology and technology, I hope to contribute to innovations that 
        improve healthcare outcomes and advance scientific discovery.

      <h2>Beyond Work</h2>
      <p>
        Outside of academics and professional projects, I enjoy exploring new technologies, 
        attending hackathons, and collaborating on group projects. I am also passionate about 
        supporting women in STEM and fostering mentorship opportunities for students entering 
        science and technology fields.
